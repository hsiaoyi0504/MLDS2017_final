# Final Project of MLDS2017@NTU

In our final projcet, we investigated two tasks to evaluate the performance of CNN and RNN on text-related tasks.

### Repo Structure:
- `text_classification/` folder contains the source code for text classification

### Usage:
- `python text_classification/cnn.py` to run basic CNN for text classification
- `python text_classification/cnn.py` to run CNN combining different filter sizes
